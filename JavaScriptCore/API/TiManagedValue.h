@interface
@discussion TiManagedValue represents a "conditionally retained" TiValue. 
 "Conditionally retained" means that as long as either the TiManagedValue's 
 JavaScript value is reachable through the JavaScript object graph
 or the TiManagedValue object is reachable through the external Objective-C 
 object graph as reported to the TiVirtualMachine using 
 addManagedReference:withOwner:, the corresponding JavaScript value will 
 be retained. However, if neither of these conditions are true, the 
 corresponding TiValue will be released and set to nil.

 The primary use case for TiManagedValue is for safely referencing TiValues 
 from the Objective-C heap. It is incorrect to store a TiValue into an 
 Objective-C heap object, as this can very easily create a reference cycle, 
 keeping the entire TiContext alive.
